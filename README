This project uses a database that holds Summoner objects that can be linked to many Match objects.
Summoner holds the name of the summoner, where Match keeps track of the champion used in that game, and their associated kills/deaths/assists
The main site isn't very robust, but has a link that will bring you to a list of summoners
You can click on a summoner to display their most recent match statistics
